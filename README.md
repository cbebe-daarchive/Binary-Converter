# Binary Representation

Bugs (Resolved):

- when the number overflows and another byte is added,
  = the number doesn't update the bits
  = does not remove overflow class from bytes
- when a byte is removed,
  ++ can be solved by getting the input from the text field instead of the bytes

## Future Plans

- Add tooltips
- Add "Copied to clipboard" message
- Maybe a new layout so the buttons don't move every time the bytes are deleted
- Overflow message
- Bit operations (shifting, and, or, not, xor)
- Signed integer values
